## Per-Developer Personal Reference Documentation (Cursor User Only, Not Committed)

Located in `cursor/` directory - **Cursor SDK places per-developer, development-specific reference docs here.**

This directory is for your personal reference only:
- ✅ Created by Cursor AI during your development sessions
- ✅ Explains decisions and context specific to your work
- ✅ Addresses your specific questions and issues athe point of development time
- ❌ **NOT found in upstream repo** (each developer has their own)
- ❌ **NOT committed to git** (`.gitignore`d)

**Example files you might have** (not in repo):
- `INTEGRATION_VS_E2E_EXPLANATION.md` - Explanation of testing approaches
- `YOUR_FEATURE_DESIGN.md` - Design decisions for your feature
- `DEBUGGING_SESSION_NOTES.md` - Notes from debugging a specific issue

These provide context for your development work but aren't shared with other developers.
